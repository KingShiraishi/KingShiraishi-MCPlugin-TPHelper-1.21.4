# KingShiraishi - TP Helper

This is a plugin compatible with Minecraft 1.21.4.

It displays the head-skins of all players on the server, and allows you to TP to a player by clicking their head-skins in the GUI.

Use `/tplist` to open the GUI. Aliases such as `/tl`, `/tphelper`, and `/th` are also available.
